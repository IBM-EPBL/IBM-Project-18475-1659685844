1.1	Project Overview
One of the most important factors which affect our country’s economy and financial condition is the credit system governed by the banks. The process of bank credit risk evaluation is recognized at banks across the globe. “As we know credit risk evaluation is very crucial, there is a variety of techniques are used for risk level calculation. In addition, credit risk is one of the main functions of the banking community. The prediction of credit defaulters is one of the difficult tasks for any bank. But by forecasting the loan defaulters, the banks definitely may reduce their loss by reducing their non-profit assets, so that recovery of approved loans can take place without any loss and it can play as the contributing parameter of the bank statement. This makes the study of this loan approval prediction important. Machine Learning techniques are very crucial and useful in the prediction of these types of data. We will be using classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Random-forest, KNN, and XGboost. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will be doing flask integration, develop a web interface and IBM deployment.

1.2	Purpose
The purpose of Smart Lender System is to provide a comprehensive web based platform to manage different lenders & borrowers. Lenders can specify their loan criteria, lending terms, rate of interest, mandatory documentation and agreements etc. Borrowers can then apply for loans in the system. The loan origination software checks borrower eligibility and matches it with the lending criterion according to the algorithm. The loan is disbursed after approval of the lending terms. Smart Lending system finds algorithmic match for borrower eligibility, loan terms and conditions. It eliminates repetitive manual steps that are best executed digitally and allows human expertise to be applied where it works best. Integration with credit data sources and services such as LexisNexis or Experian lets lenders automatically and quickly verify applicant information. No lost or misplaced documents. Paper documents converted to digital images are immediately and securely accessible by the underwriter, so they can review applicant materials more quickly. The combination of decision rules and integration with credit data sources and services lets lenders automatically calculate optimum loan structures and terms. 


2.1	Existing problem

A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans needs away to verify the customer details and their documents for getting loan because they need a trustable customer with proper documents who can repay the loan amount and interest on time. A lender is an individual or a financial institution that makes funds available to a person with expectation that the funds will be repaid who needs a way to easily and quickly approve the loan for a trustworthy person because manually loan approval is a time taking process. The lender needs a way to trust the borrower’s credentials so that he can give loan to the borrower with assured repayment of the loan. A lender is a party who loans out money needs a way to automate the loan prediction process because he cannot easily trust the person. A bank manager who needs a way to predict the loan approval of a person automatically because of the difficulty in manual loan prediction as he wants to hire highly professional individuals for approving loan and security issues. A bank is money lender who needs away to lend loans to its customers securely with proper interest and repayment because being impetuous might cause a lot of damage to itself.
