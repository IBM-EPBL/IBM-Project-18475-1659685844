### Dataset

A set of data used to train the model is known as a machine learning dataset. To educate the machine learning algorithm how to generate predictions, a dataset is used as an example.

### Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a stage in the data analysis process that converts raw data into a format that computers and machine learning software can understand and evaluate. Machines like to process information that is neat and orderly; they interpret data as 1s and 0s. Therefore, it is simple to calculate structured data like whole numbers and percentages. Unstructured data must be organised and cleaned up before analysis, though.

### Testing & Training

The train/test approach is a way to gauge how accurate your model is.

Because the data set is divided into two sets—a training set and a testing set—this technique is known as train/test.

Using the training set, we train the model.

Utilizing the testing set, we test the model.
