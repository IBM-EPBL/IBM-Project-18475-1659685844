### Model Building

Setting up methods for data collection, understanding and paying attention to what is significant in the data to address the questions you are posing, and finding a simulation, statistical, or mathematical model to gain understanding and make predictions are all part of the model-building process.

### Pickle

Pickle is primarily used in Python to serialise and deserialize Python object structures. To put it another way, it is the procedure of converting a Python object into a byte stream so that it can be stored in a file or database, have its state preserved across sessions, or be used to transfer data over a network.

### Testing & Training

The train/test approach is a way to gauge how accurate your model is.

Because the data set is divided into two sets—a training set and a testing set—this technique is known as train/test.

Using the training set, we train the model.

Utilizing the testing set, we test the model.
